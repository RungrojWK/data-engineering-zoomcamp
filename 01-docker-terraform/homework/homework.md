# üñãÔ∏è Module 1 Homework: Docker & SQL

This README provides solutions to various questions related to Docker, SQL, and Terraform workflows. Each section includes the problem, relevant SQL queries or Docker configurations, and the solutions.

---

## Question 1: Understanding Docker First Run

Run Docker with the `python:3.12.8` image in interactive mode and use `bash` as the entrypoint.

**What is the version of `pip` in the image?**

**Solution:**  
![Solution Image](picture/01_solve.png)

The answer is: **`24.3.1`**

---

## Question 2: Docker Networking and Docker-Compose

Given the following `docker-compose.yaml`, what is the `hostname` and `port` that **pgAdmin** should use to connect to the PostgreSQL database?

```yaml
services:
  db:
    container_name: postgres
    image: postgres:17-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: "postgres"
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "postgres"
      POSTGRES_DB: "ny_taxi"
    ports:
      - "5433:5432"
    volumes:
      - vol-pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  pgadmin:
    container_name: pgadmin
    image: dpage/pgadmin4:latest
    environment:
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: "pgadmin@pgadmin.com"
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: "pgadmin"
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - vol-pgadmin_data:/var/lib/pgadmin

volumes:
  vol-pgdata:
    name: vol-pgdata
  vol-pgadmin_data:
    name: vol-pgadmin_data
```

**Solution:**  
![Solution Image](picture/02_solve.png)

The answer is: **`postgres:5432`**

## Question 3: Trip Segmentation Count

For trips between October 1st, 2019 (inclusive) and November 1st, 2019 (exclusive), how many trips occurred:

1. Up to 1 mile
2. Between 1 (exclusive) and 3 miles (inclusive)
3. Between 3 (exclusive) and 7 miles (inclusive)
4. Between 7 (exclusive) and 10 miles (inclusive)
5. Over 10 miles

```sql
SELECT
    SUM(CASE WHEN trip_distance <= 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS up_to_1_mile,
    SUM(CASE WHEN trip_distance > 1 AND trip_distance <= 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS between_1_and_3_miles,
    SUM(CASE WHEN trip_distance > 3 AND trip_distance <= 7 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS between_3_and_7_miles,
    SUM(CASE WHEN trip_distance > 7 AND trip_distance <= 10 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS between_7_and_10_miles,
    SUM(CASE WHEN trip_distance > 10 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS over_10_miles
FROM green_taxi_trips
WHERE lpep_pickup_datetime >= '2019-10-01'
  AND lpep_dropoff_datetime < '2019-11-01';
```

![Solution Image](picture/03_solve.png)

The answer is: **`104,802; 198,924; 109,603; 27,678; 35,189`**

---

## Question 4: Longest Trip for Each Day

Which was the pickup day with the longest trip distance? Use the pickup time for your calculations.

**Tip:** For every day, we only care about one single trip with the longest distance.

![Solution Image](picture/04_solve.png)

The answer is: **`2019-10-11`**

---

## Question 5: Three Biggest Pickup Zones

Which were the top pickup locations with over 13,000 in `total_amount` (across all trips) for 2019-10-18?

Consider only `lpep_pickup_datetime` when filtering by date.

```sql
SELECT tz."Zone", SUM(tp."total_amount")
FROM green_taxi_trips tp
INNER JOIN taxi_zone tz
    ON tp."PULocationID" = tz."LocationID"
WHERE tp.lpep_pickup_datetime >= '2019-10-18'
    AND tp.lpep_pickup_datetime < '2019-10-19'
GROUP BY tz."Zone"
ORDER BY SUM(tp."total_amount") DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

![Solution Image](picture/05_solve.png)

The answer is: **`East Harlem North, East Harlem South, Morningside Heights`**

---

## Question 6: Largest Tip

For passengers picked up in October 2019 in the zone named "East Harlem North," which was the drop-off zone that had the largest tip?

**Note:** It's `tip`, not `trip`. We need the name of the zone, not the ID.

```sql
SELECT tzd."Zone" AS drop_off_zone, MAX(tp.tip_amount) AS tips
FROM green_taxi_trips tp
LEFT JOIN taxi_zone tzp
ON tp."PULocationID" = tzp."LocationID"
LEFT JOIN taxi_zone tzd
ON tp."DOLocationID" = tzd."LocationID"
WHERE tp.lpep_pickup_datetime >= '2019-10-1'
    AND tp.lpep_pickup_datetime < '2019-11-1'
    AND tzp."Zone" = 'East Harlem North'
GROUP BY tzd."Zone"
ORDER BY MAX(tp.tip_amount) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

![Solution Image](picture/06_solve.png)

The answer is: **`JFK Airport`**

## Question 7: Terraform Workflow

Which of the following sequences, **respectively**, describes the workflow for:

1. Downloading the provider plugins and setting up the backend.
2. Generating proposed changes and auto-executing the plan.
3. Removing all resources managed by Terraform.

![Solution Image](picture/07_1_solve.png)

```
$ terraform apply -auto-approve

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 2 to destroy.

Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value: yes

google_storage_bucket.demo-bucket: Destroying... [id=terraform-demo-448604-terra-bucket]
google_bigquery_dataset.demo_dataset: Destroying... [id=projects/terraform-demo-448604/datasets/demo_dataset]
google_bigquery_dataset.demo_dataset: Destruction complete after 1s
google_storage_bucket.demo-bucket: Destruction complete after 2s

Destroy complete! Resources: 2 destroyed.
```

The answer is: **`terraform init, terraform apply -auto-approve, terraform destroy`**
