## 🚀 Modules and Topics

### Module 1: **Docker and Terraform Setup**

- **What I Learned:**  
  In this module, I gained practical experience with **Docker** to containerize Python scripts for data processing using libraries like `pandas` and `sqlalchemy`. I also used **Docker Compose** to set up and manage PostgreSQL and pgAdmin containers for database operations.

  Additionally, I explored **Terraform**, using it to automate infrastructure provisioning on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** by creating BigQuery datasets and Cloud Storage buckets. I also strengthened my understanding of **SQL** basics while working with PostgreSQL.

  This module provided a strong foundation in containerization, infrastructure automation, and database management.
